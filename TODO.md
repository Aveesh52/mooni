## ðŸ’­ TODO

Here's a list of the features we're planning to implement. Mooni is open source, we're also open to pull requests !

* Display user's balance and block higher amounts.
* Improve 3box integration (load existing data, don't replace if empty...)
* Allow to create an order without wallet, display deposit address (add BTC?)
* Support more wallet providers \(Ledger, Fortmatic, Authereum, ?\). Check web3modal
* In widget mode, add possibility for host to pass his own wallet provider, so that user doesn't have to login again in mooni

* Pro-actively check if browser support cross-domain cookies (required for placing orders)
